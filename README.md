# About-Me
I'm a passionate student exploring the breadth of software engineering and development, game development, AI/ML, and animation. My top technical skills are in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning using Python, as well as Data Structures & Algorithms with C++. While I haven't started any formal projects yet, I'm actively learning and building my expertise.

Beyond technology, I enjoy playing chess, learning about psychology, reading books, and writing novels. I believe in continuous growth and my favorite quote is:
"The best time to start was yesterday, the second best time is now."
